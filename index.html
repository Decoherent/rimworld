Uses Assets From:<br />
Fashionrimsta (Overalls)<br />
While the lingering fear of Cthulhu is most unnerving, you are not alone. The Agency and coastal fishing villages have appeared in the overworld.<br />
The detectives from The Agency dress themselves with proper detective gear including bowler caps, fedoras, shirts with ties, and trench coats.<br />
Citizens from the coastal fishing villages wear occupational attire including: police uniforms with caps, farmer overalls and straw hats, raincoats and slicker hats, and nurse uniforms with caps.<br />
Top hats, newsboy caps, are also now included.<br />
Finally, a special branch of the Agency used to root out monstrous forces can be seen wearing lighter special forces gear. They are called M.E.R.F. (Mobile Eldritch Response Force), and they come equipped with combat armor and helmets (light and heavy variants).<br />
Have fun!</p>

This is an attempt to create the minor races of H.P. Lovecraft's weird fiction mythos in the RimWorld engine. They behave the same as hostile factions that raid colonies such as mechanoids or insectoids. They are deadlier, however.<br />
Currently Included Monsters:<br />
*Star-Spawn of Cthulhu<br />
*Shoggoths<br />
*Mi-Go<br />
*Deep Ones<br />
*Star Vampire<br />
*Dark Young<br />
*NEW - Chthonian<br />
Incidents:<br />
*Monster Raids<br />
*Dark Young Herd<br />
*Invisible Star Vampire Attack<br />
*Chthonian Pit<br />
Notes:<br />
Each monster has its own unique anatomical skeletons, organs, and body parts. Some special powers were given to psionic beasts.<br />
Each monster has special sound effects.<br />
More creatures will be added in updates in the future.<br />
Since I am one person, I can't attest to how balanced the monsters are, and I am definitely looking for feedback from player experiences. Let me know how they are in your game.<br />
Update 5:<br />
*Chthonians<br />
Update 4:<br />

<p>Version: 1.8.6<br />
A little mod that adds eight carefully balanced turret variations, each unique in its own way with the attempt to keep their vanilla art style.<br />
[This is a temporary port until Marnador updates to Beta 18 because I just couldn't wait]</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=761219125">Defensive Positions</a> by UnlimitedHugs</h5>

<p>Version: 1.5.2<br />
<size=20>Description</size><br />
Allows your colonists to remember their position during base defense. You can send off your colonists to their positions with a single click.<br />
<size=20>How to use</size><br />
<b>Set defensive positions for colonists</b><br />
1) Draft your defenders and place them where you want them.<br />
2) With your defenders selected, hold the Shift key and click the Defensive position button (or press T).<br />
Done. The selected colonists will remember their held positions.<br />
<b>Send colonists to saved positions</b><br />
1) Select your defenders.<br />
2) Click the Defensive position button (or press T).<br />
Your defenders will be drafted and will run to their saved positions.<br />
<b>Advanced mode</b><br />
Hold the Alt key and click the Defensive position button to switch between basic and advanced mode.<br />
Advanced mode works exactly like Basic, but you have 4 positions to work with. Shift+click a slot to save a position, just click to send the selected pawns to the position they have been assigned under that number.<br />
Pressing T is the same as clicking the first slot.<br />
<b>Squad hotkeys</b><br />
Colonists can be assigned to squads for easier selection. To assign, hold the Ctrl key and press 1-9 on the numeric keypad to assign the squad to that key. Press the numeric key of a squad to select the pawns, press again to focus on the squad location.<br />
<b>Utility hotkeys</b><br />
There are three other keys on the keypad for quick colonist management: press period to select all colonists on the map, undraft everyone by pressing divide, and press zero to send all colonists to their assigned defensive position.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=949498803">Haul to Stack</a> by ItsComcastic</h5>

<p>Version .18<br />
Instead of hauling to random tiles your pawn <em>should</em> always haul to a stack if it has room on it<br />
Features<br />
Haulers will check for an existing stack to add it's item to.<br />
Haulers no longer reserve the haul-to tile meaning multiple pawns can haul to the same tile at once.<br />
Issues<br />
You may still see your pawns haul to different stacks, this will happen under the following conditions:<br />
there are no existing stacks,<br />
the existing stacks are full<br />
Example:  If you get a pod drop with new loot and two pawns pickup some before any is placed, they might pick different spots in the stockpile to haul to.  I'm working on a system where they can share with eachother which tile they plan on placing new loot on which should fix that issue and prevent the need for Stack Merger by Fluffy<br />
Conflicts<br />
It looks like there might be a conflict with a wall light mod if your stash runs against the wall light.  If you have wall lights against your stash take that tile out of your stockpile zone to prevent pawns from going into a loop of trying to haul over and over.  This issue isn't fixable by changing mod order unfortunately, I'll have to work with the mod creater on a solution.<br />
This overwrites the builtin JobDriver_HaulToCell.  If any other mods overwrite the JobDriver for hauling this mod will throw tile reservation errors.  This mod should be compatible with most other mods but let me know if you have any problems.<br />
<strong>* IMPORTANT *</strong><br />
If you want to remove or turn off this mod you need to first make sure no one is performing or going to do a hauling job.<br />
You can force this by pausing, drafting any pawns where their state says they're 'Hauling", save.. turn off the mod, then load that save and undraft the pawns.  If you don't do this the pawn and what they were holding will 'disappear' and the game will throw errors.  If you reload your 'broken' save with the mod they should reappear.<br />
Recommendations<br />
Install Stack Merger by Fluffy in addition to this mod.<br />

Simple parts are slightly lower in efficiency than natural parts. Bionic parts are higher.<br />
All parts need medicine skill and 1 medicine to be installed. <br />
Simple parts need a skill from 4-6. Bionic parts need a skill form 8-10.<br />

DMG on bionic parts is non variable from animal to animal. A fully bionic Yorkie will do the same damage as a fully bionic Thrumbo.<br />

<p>Replace wall type and doors on the fly. No need to deconstruct and then build another. Features smart building where it won't try to replace walls that are already that type.

Mod makers can look into the Vaccine class comments to see how to make new walls/doors/conduits replaceable without this mod updating to support them.<br />
Note: this is a quick and dirty update to Jamestec's A16 build to ensure compatibility with B18. If he makes a new version of his mod, I'll take this one down.<br />
